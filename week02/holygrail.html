                <p>This is a page describing the Holy Grail, while also being a website to challenge myself to do a little better at html website creation. My goal in this website is to both do my job in coding practice and studying well while also being funny, i.e., showing everyone the trailer for Monty Python and the Holy Grail if they choose to watch it.</p>
