        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Elise Beyeler, and I am so happy to be in this class! I had a hectic enter into this semester of BYUI-Online, so I am very grateful I can be here working today.</p>
        <p>This class is proving to be more challenging and more fun than I thought! Turns out I love analytical, coding, and engineering things. They all greatly intruige me and make me think!</p> 
        <p>I love seeing ideas come to life! I love art and being creative in any fashion, so I often imagine several different things I could do with my life. I hope to do them all someday!</p>

            <p>I live in Missouri, which is a state in the United States of America. I love it here, for it's tempermental climate and relaxing rainy days during the early spring and summer. I also love light thunderstorms and the amazing growth plants are able to go through here.The picture I picked of Missouri is in the northern part of Missouri, about two hours north of Kansas City, a large city on the Kansas-Missouri border. The place is called "Adam-ondi-ahman", meaning "Adam with God", and is a staple place of the Far West history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I love it for its beauty, peacful engergy, personal spiritual connection, and to the past. It's always very relaxing there.</p>
