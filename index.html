            <h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hello! I am Elise Beyeler, and I am so happy to be in this class! I had a hectic enter into this semester of BYUI-Online, so I am very grateful I can be here working today.</p>
<p>This class is proving to be more challenging and more fun than I thought! Turns out I love analytical, coding, and engineering things. They all greatly intruige me and make me think!</p> 
<p>I love seeing ideas come to life! I love art and being creative in any fashion, so I often imagine several different things I could do with my life. I hope to do them all someday!</p>
