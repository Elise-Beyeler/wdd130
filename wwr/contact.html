                    <h3>Important Notes About the River:</h3>
                    <p>We navigate the river from March to November, and the river must be in a specific condition for us to consider it safe to navigate.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The river must be at least 12ft deep for us to consider navigating it.</li>
                        <li>If rain begins to fall while you are on the river, it is mandatory for the rafting guides to pull their parties off of the river and wait for the river escorts to return to bring everyone back to the riverfront.</li>
                        <li>River pollutants or seasonal migrations may inhibit swimming in the river, or inhibit rafting altogether.</li>
                    </ul>
